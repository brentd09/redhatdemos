In the realm of code where dreams ignite,  
A system emerged to everyone's delight.  
Born of collaboration and vision so grand,  
Linux spread throughout the land.

Invisible hands shaped each line,  
Crafting a world both robust and divine.  
From hobbyist hearts to enterprise scale,  
Linux carved paths on every trail.

Once a kernel, humble and small,  
Now on servers and desktops it stands tall.  
In smartphones and gadgets, a silent force,  
Powering innovation, setting the course.

A community bound by open-source creed,  
Where anyone can join, contribute, and lead.  
A tapestry of tweaks, tweaks, and spins,  
A collective of minds where everyone wins.

In classrooms and offices, homes and clouds,  
Linux echoes, proud and loud.  
Its flexibility and freedom, a beacon bright,  
Guiding the world in technological light.

As penguins march in steady pace,  
Their operating system claims its place.  
A tale of revolution, this story unfolds,  
Of how Linux took the world in its hold.
