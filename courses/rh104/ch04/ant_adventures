In a meadow bright and wide,
Young Andy Ant took a daring stride,
Leaving behind his colony strong,
He sought adventure, where he felt he'd belong.  

Through the flowers, he danced with glee,
But soon the shadows loomed ominously.
As the sun dipped low, he felt a chill,
All alone, his heart stood still.  

The beauty turned daunting, the path was unclear,
He missed the safety, his friends so dear.
With every step, he wished to be,
Back with his colony, their camaraderie.  

At last, he heard their familiar hum,
Relief washed over him like the beat of a drum.
Together they thrived, side by side,
In unity, true adventure could abide.  

Now Andy knows, as he journeys along,
With friends by his side, he canâ€™t go wrong.
For the greatest tales are not just of one,
But woven together, where joy is spun.
