The Rise of Linux

Thirty years, a tale unfolds,
A rebel's dream, so brave and bold.
In '91, a seed was sown,
By Linus’ hands, the world was shown.

A kernel free, a hope so wide,
No walls to build, no gates to hide.
Hackers, coders, joined the call,
A system shaped to serve them all.

From humble roots to global might,
Servers hum, the clouds take flight.
On phones, on space-bound ships it runs,
A billion tasks, a million suns.

No kings, no chains, just lines of code,
A gift that countless hands bestowed.
Through every fork, through every fight,
The penguin rose, still shining bright.

And so it grows, no end in sight,
A beacon strong in open light.
For freedom’s code will always be,
The soul of Linux—wild and free!
